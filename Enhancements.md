# 🚀 Projected Enhancements – `planet` Database Schema

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines a set of actionable enhancements aimed at improving the **performance**, **scalability**, and **maintainability** of the `planet` schema used for Continuous Improvement and VoC analytics.

---

## 🗂️ Recommended Enhancements

### 1️⃣ **Indexing Strategy**

- 📌 **Action:** Review and implement composite indexes on frequently joined and filtered columns, especially:
  - `agent_id`
  - `department_id`
  - `Date` fields
- 🎯 **Benefit:** Faster query execution for analytical views and reporting dashboards.

---

### 2️⃣ **Partitioning Large Tables**

- 📌 **Action:** Implement time-based partitioning (e.g., by month or year) for high-volume tables:
  - `call_agent`
  - `VoC`
  - `repeat_rate`
- 🎯 **Benefit:** Reduces scan time and improves performance for queries with date filters.

---

### 3️⃣ **Materialized View Refresh Automation**

- 📌 **Action:** Automate refresh schedules for key materialized views such as `Productivity_difference` and any summary tables.
- 🎯 **Benefit:** Keeps aggregated metrics up-to-date while balancing performance.

---

### 4️⃣ **Stored Procedures for ETL**

- 📌 **Action:** Centralize complex logic into reusable stored procedures for data cleansing, enrichment, and transformations.
- 🎯 **Benefit:** Simplifies maintenance and ensures consistency across pipelines.

---

### 5️⃣ **Data Quality Validation Layer**

- 📌 **Action:** Expand triggers or use periodic validation scripts to detect anomalies (e.g., outliers, negative durations).
- 🎯 **Benefit:** Maintains data integrity for decision-making.

---

### 6️⃣ **Performance Monitoring**

- 📌 **Action:** Implement query performance monitoring using `pg_stat_statements` and automated alerts for slow-running queries.
- 🎯 **Benefit:** Proactively identify bottlenecks and tune queries.

---

### 7️⃣ **Documentation & Data Dictionary**

- 📌 **Action:** Maintain an updated **data dictionary** with clear field definitions, relationships, and owners.
- 🎯 **Benefit:** Reduces onboarding time and improves cross-team understanding.

---

### 8️⃣ **Archiving Policy**

- 📌 **Action:** Define and implement a historical archiving strategy for aged data (e.g., older than 3 years).
- 🎯 **Benefit:** Optimizes storage and keeps operational queries lean.

---

### 9️⃣ **Role-Based Access Control**

- 📌 **Action:** Enforce fine-grained permissions using PostgreSQL roles for sensitive tables like `VoC`.
- 🎯 **Benefit:** Enhances data security and compliance.

---

### 🔟 **Performance Testing & Benchmarking**

- 📌 **Action:** Establish a test suite to benchmark the impact of schema changes before deployment.
- 🎯 **Benefit:** Validates optimizations and avoids regressions.

---

## ✅ **Next Steps**

- Prioritize enhancements based on usage patterns and performance metrics.
- Develop a phased roadmap with clear owners and timelines.
- Integrate enhancements with Continuous Improvement initiatives for maximum impact.
